## About

**Durbyn** is a Julia package that implements the functionality of the R **forecast** package, providing tools for time series forecasting. The name Durbyn traces back to Kurdish, where Dur means “far” and Byn means “to see,” together signifying binoculars, which is why the package logo features them.

This package is currently under development and will be part of the **TAFS Forecasting Ecosystem**, an open-source initiative.

## About TAFS

**TAFS (Time Series Analysis and Forecasting Society)** is a non-profit association registered as a **"Verein"** in Vienna, Austria. The organization connects a global audience of academics, experts, practitioners, and students to engage, share, learn, and innovate in the fields of data science and artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on time-series analysis, forecasting, and decision science. [TAFS](https://taf-society.org/)

TAFS's mission includes:

-   **Connecting**: Hosting events and discussion groups to establish connections and build a community of like-minded individuals.
-   **Learning**: Providing a platform to learn about the latest research, real-world problems, and applications.
-   **Sharing**: Inviting experts, academics, practitioners, and others to present and discuss problems, research, and solutions.
-   **Innovating**: Supporting the transfer of research into solutions and helping to drive innovations.

As a registered non-profit association under Austrian law, TAFS ensures that all contributions remain fully open source and cannot be privatized or commercialized. [TAFS](https://taf-society.org/)

## License

The Durbyn package is licensed under the **MIT License**, allowing for open-source distribution and collaboration.

## Installation

Durbyn is still in development. Once it is officially released, you will be able to install it using Julia’s package manager:

For the latest development version, you can install directly from GitHub:

``` julia
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/taf-society/Durbyn.jl")
```

## Usage

### Forecasting using Exponential Smoothing.

``` julia

using Durbyn
using Durbyn.ExponentialSmoothing

ap = air_passengers();
fit_ets = ets(ap, 12, "ZZZ")
fc_ets = forecast(fit_ets, h = 12)
plot(fc_ets)


ses_fit = ses(ap)
ses_fc = forecast(ses_fit, h = 12)
plot(ses_fc)


holt_fit = holt(ap)
holt_fc = forecast(holt_fit, h = 12)
plot(holt_fc)


hw_fit = holt_winters(ap, 12)
hw_fc = forecast(hw_fit, h = 12)
plot(hw_fc)
```

### Forecasting Intermittent Demand Data

``` julia
data = [6, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0,
0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 
0, 0, 0, 0, 0];

# Based on Shenstone, L., and Hyndman, R.J. (2005)

fit_crst =croston(data)
fc_crst = forecast(fit_crst, 12)
plot(fc_crst)

# this module is based on Kourentzes (2014)
using Durbyn.IntermittentDemand

# Classical Croston Method based Croston, J. (1972) 
crst1 =croston_classic(data)
fc1 = forecast(crst1, h = 12)

residuals(crst1)
residuals(fc1)

fitted(crst1)
fitted(fc1)

plot(fc1, show_fitted = true)

# Croston Method with Syntetos-Boylan Approximation
crst2 =croston_sba(data)
fc2 = forecast(crst2, h = 12)

residuals(crst2)
residuals(fc2)

fitted(crst2)
fitted(fc2)

plot(fc2, show_fitted = true)

# Croston-Shale-Boylan-Johnston Bias Correction Method
crst3 =croston_sbj(data)
fc3 = forecast(crst3, h = 12)

residuals(crst3)
residuals(fc3)

fitted(crst3)
fitted(fc3)

plot(fc3, show_fitted = true)
```

### Forecasting using Arima

``` julia
using Durbyn.Arima
# Fit an arima model
fit = arima(ap, 12, order = PDQ(2,1,1), seasonal=PDQ(0,1,0))

## Generate a forecast
fc = forecast(fit, h = 12)
# Plot the forecast
plot(fc)

# Fit an auto arima model
fit = auto_arima(ap, 12)

## Generate a forecast
fc = forecast(fit, h = 12)
# Plot the forecast
plot(fc)
```

### Forecasting using Ararma and Arar models

``` julia
# Ararma module

using Durbyn
using Durbyn.Ararma

ap = air_passengers();

# basing arar model
fit = arar(ap, max_ar_depth = 13)
fc = forecast(fit, h = 12)
plot(fc)

# arar model
fit = ararma(ap, p = 0, q = 1)
fc = forecast(fit, h = 12)
plot(fc)

# auto arar model
fit = auto_ararma(ap)
fc = forecast(fit, h = 12)
plot(fc)
```

Durbyn will introduce a **DataFrame-based interface** (tidy forecasting) similar to the **R fable** package, allowing for a more intuitive workflow when working with time series data.
