Fit an ARIMA model to a **univariate** time series.

This is a Julia adaptation of Rob J. Hyndman's ARIMA routine (a wrapper around
`stats::arima`) with two key extensions: support for a **drift** term and
optional **Box-Cox transformation** with mean (bias) adjustment on the
back-transformed scale. You can also pass a previously fitted model and
re-apply it to new data `y` without re-estimating parameters.

# Arguments
- `y`: Univariate time series (vector or `AbstractArray`) to be modeled.
- `m::Int`: Seasonal period (e.g., 12 for monthly data, 4 for quarterly).
- `order::PDQ`: Non-seasonal orders `(p, d, q)`.
- `seasonal::PDQ`: Seasonal orders `(P, D, Q)`; use `m` to control the period.
- `xreg::Union{Nothing,NamedMatrix}`: Optional exogenous regressors with the same number of rows as `y`. Must be numeric; not a DataFrame.
- `include_mean::Bool = true`: Include an intercept/mean term for **undifferenced** series; ignored when differencing is present in a way that the mean is not identifiable.
- `include_drift::Bool = false`: Include a **linear drift** term (i.e., regression with ARIMA errors).
- `include_constant = nothing`: If `true`, sets `include_mean = true` for undifferenced series and `include_drift = true` for differenced series. If more than one difference is taken in total (`d + D > 1`), **no constant** is included regardless of this setting (to avoid inducing higher-order polynomial trends).
- `lambda = nothing`: Box-Cox transformation parameter.
  - `nothing` → no transformation.
  - Real value → apply Box-Cox with that λ (`λ = 0` corresponds to log transform, `λ = 1` to no transform).
  - `:auto` (if used) → select λ automatically (BoxCox.lambda equivalent).
- `biasadj::Bool = false`: When `lambda` is set, use bias-adjusted back-transformation so that fitted values and forecasts approximate **means** on the original scale (otherwise they approximate medians).
- `method::String = "CSS-ML"`: Estimation method. One of `"CSS-ML"`, `"ML"`, `"CSS"`.
  - `"CSS-ML"` uses Conditional Sum of Squares for starts, then Maximum Likelihood.
  - `"ML"` uses full Maximum Likelihood.
  - `"CSS"` minimizes Conditional Sum of Squares.
- `model::Union{Nothing,ArimaFit} = nothing`: Output from a previous call; when provided, the same model structure is refit to `y` **without** re-estimating parameters.
- `kwargs...`: Passed through to the underlying optimizer/likelihood routine (advanced use).

# Details
The fitted model is a regression with ARIMA errors:

 ```math
y_t = c + β' x_t + z_t
```

where `x_t` are exogenous regressors (if any) and `z_t` follows an
ARIMA(p, d, q)*(P, D, Q)[m] process.  
If there are no regressors and `d = D = 0`, the intercept `c` estimates the
series mean. When a Box-Cox transform is used, the model is estimated on the
transformed scale; fitted values and forecasts are then back-transformed, with
optional bias adjustment (`biasadj = true`) to target the mean on the original
scale.

# Returns
An [`ArimaFit`] object containing:
- `model::ArimaFit`: coefficients, fitted values, residuals, information criteria,
  likelihood, variance estimates, convergence info, etc.

Notable components inside `model` include:
- `sigma2`: Bias-adjusted MLE of the innovation variance.
- `x`: The (possibly transformed) time series used in estimation.
- `xreg`: The regressors used (if supplied).

# Notes
- `include_constant=true` is a convenience that sets sensible defaults for
  `include_mean`/`include_drift` based on differencing, mirroring Hyndman's design.
- If `d + D > 1`, no constant is included irrespective of settings, to avoid
  induced quadratic or higher-order trends.
- Passing `model` refits that model structure to `y` without re-optimization.
